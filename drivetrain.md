# Drivetrain

#### Design Goals & Criteria:

* Mechanically simple for less modifications and tuning
* Uses two-speed WCP Flipped-DS gearboxes
* Can both quickly traverse field while also maintaining good mobility
* Clears the on-field cable covers as well as the Scale Platform

#### Prototyping & Design Discussion

* We chose to reuse the general WCD concept, as we used it in the 2017 season with great success
* For easier forwards mechanism placement we opted to locate gearboxes in the rear of robot
* Various wheel options were considered:
    * 4" Colson Performa
        * Good wear resistance and traction
        * Have hex hub already molded to wheel
        * Concerns about ground clearance with the Scale Platform
    * 6" Colson Perfoma
        * Similar wear & traction characteristics stated above
        * Less maintenance compared to pneumatic wheels of similar size
        * Hard to acquire (size we needed has been discontinued)
        * Requires the pressing in of a custom or COTS hub
        * No resistance to bumps or added cushioning
    * 6" West Coast Products Pneumatic Wheels
        * Great cushioning and dampening
        * Strong CNC-machined hubs
        * More parts to fail (tubes, tires, and wheel)
        * Requires constant attention and inflation
* Had to run chain on the exterior of
