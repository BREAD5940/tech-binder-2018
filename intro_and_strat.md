# Introduction

We began the season with a basic analysis of the 2018 game, _FIRST_ POWER UP. There are several scoring objectives we considered viable to our team.

* Switch & Vault Only
    * A small agile robot can shuttle power cubes across the field quickly, filling our switch.
    * Filling the vault in a timely manner allows us to apply Power Ups when we want, granting us the ability to control the match better
    * Requires significantly less resources to design and build, allowing for more time to test
* Scale-capable Robot
    * Can compete with other alliance for scale ownership
    * Scale robots may be more scarce, allowing for us to potentially own the scale the entire match
    * Allows us to gain experience with a more mechanically complex mechanism
    * Could put a power cube on the scale in auto, thus allowing us to own it sooner
    * Contains many of the "Switch & Vault" benefits

Considering the following and our team capabilities, we decided on our "Scale-capable Robot" concept. We then set to define the various characteristics our robot needed to have to be successful.

### Robot Will

* Score a Power Cube in autonomous
* Be able to effectively and efficiently intake Power Cubes and deliver them with a high degree of accuracy
* Reach both the Scale and the Switch
* Place a Power Cube above at least one Cube already in the Switch or Scale
* Navigate the obstacles of both the cable protector and the Scale Platform
* Put Power Cubes through the Exchange
* Minimize the risk of robot falling or tipping

Following these ideals, we began to prototype and design Baguette.
