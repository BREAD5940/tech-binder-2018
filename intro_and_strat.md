# Introduction

We began the season with a basic analysis of the 2018 game, _FIRST_ POWER UP. There are several scoring objectives we considered viable to our team.

* Switch & Vault Only
    * A small agile robot can shuttle power cubes across the field quickly, filling our switch.
    * Filling the vault in a timely manner allows us to apply Power Ups when we want, granting us the ability to control the match better
    * Requires significantly less resources to design and build, allowing for more time to test
* Scale-capable Robot
