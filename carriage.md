# Carriage

#### Design Goals & Criteria

* Slides smoothly and is frictionless through entire range of travel
* Tightly constrained inside inner frame
* Has area for mounting intake
* Integrates a method for pivoting the intake downwards at the beginning of the match

Minimal prototyping was needed once the elevator mechanism and structure was defined.

#### Carriage Overview

* 1/4" Aluminum Plate construction attached with ThunderHex standoffs
    * Stiff with excellent ridgity in multiple dimensions
    * Has multiple attachment points for different mechanisms
* Integrated bearing roller solutions
    * Has multiple bearings in each dimension
    * Keeps the carriage from racking side-to-side and front-to-back
* Uses a rotational force dampener to rotate intake mechanism down at match start
    * Less complexity by using gravity to actuate intake lowering
